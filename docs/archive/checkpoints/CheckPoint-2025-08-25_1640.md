# Checkpoint - 2025-08-25_1640

## Context Summary
QR Watermark Wizard enhancement planning session - Updated project documentation to reflect current production state and planned AI image generation integration. Transformed generic playbook into project-specific development guide.

## Accomplishments This Session
- ✅ **Project Plan Enhancement**: Updated `docs/QRMR-Project-Plan.md` with comprehensive AI image generation roadmap
- ✅ **Architecture Documentation**: Verified actual codebase aligns with documented architecture
- ✅ **Enhancement Planning**: Designed AI integration approach compatible with existing PyQt6 stack
- ✅ **Playbook Customization**: Transformed generic `.claude/claude.md` into QR Watermark Wizard-specific guide

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified:
- **docs/QRMR-Project-Plan.md**: Major enhancement
  - Added Priority 1: AI Image Generation Integration section
  - Updated from basic architecture to comprehensive enhancement roadmap
  - Added 6-week implementation timeline with phases
  - Updated success metrics and development team info
  - Repositioned existing priorities (2-5) to accommodate AI features

- **.claude/claude.md**: Complete project-specific transformation
  - Changed title from generic "QRMR-Project-Plan" to "QR Watermark Wizard Playbook"
  - Updated project purpose and technical stack specifications
  - Replaced generic guardrails with PyQt6/PIL/AI-specific requirements
  - Added actual file paths and architecture components
  - Updated quality gates and release hygiene for desktop application
  - Added current version tracking section

### Architecture Review Results:
- **Current State**: Production-ready v1.07.31 UI / v1.07.15 Engine
- **Code Verification**: Actual architecture matches documented structure
- **AI Integration Strategy**: Tab-based extension leveraging existing QThread patterns
- **Compatibility Assessment**: Current PyQt6 stack can accommodate AI features without rewrite

## Known Issues / Blockers
- None identified - project is in stable production state
- AI integration will require new dependencies (OpenAI, Claude MCP, aiohttp)

## Next Session Priorities
1. **Begin AI Integration Phase 1**: Add required dependencies and core architecture components
2. **UI Architecture Extension**: Design tab-based interface for generation workflow
3. **API Connector Development**: Start with OpenAI DALL-E integration as primary provider

## Backlog Movement
**Added to Priority 1:**
- AI Image Generation Integration (6-week roadmap)
- Complete generate → review → revise → accept → watermark pipeline
- Multi-provider support (OpenAI, Claude MCP, Stable Diffusion)

**Existing Priorities Renumbered:**
- Core Engine Improvements moved to Priority 2
- UI/UX Enhancements moved to Priority 3
- Professional Features moved to Priority 4
- Business Intelligence moved to Priority 5

## Git Status
- **Branch**: main
- **Last Commit**: 17c55a1 chore: add .claude/settings.local.json to .gitignore
- **Modified Files**: docs/QRMR-Project-Plan.md, .claude/claude.md
- **Status**: Ready for commit and push
